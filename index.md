##Lab Report 1 - Remote Access and FileSystem (Week 1)

#Section 1 : Installing VScode (*First Time Setup*)
1. First, if Visual Studio Code is not installed on your device click on the link [Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and follow the directions to install. If you are using a lab computer, like during lab time, Visual Studio is already installed and this step can be skipped.
2. Since git is a neccesary step of using VScode and neccesary to correctly use commands you install git at [Link](https://gitforwindows.org/). From there you click on download and click through all of the installations (You don't need to alter any of the intstallation settings)
3. Next follow these steps during your first time launching Visual Studio (and if Bash isn't running on VScode. These were the steps given to us during class. You can skip Step 1 if you had already downloaded git.)
